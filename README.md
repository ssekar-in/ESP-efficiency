# Electrostatic Precipitator efficiency
This is a simple ESP efficiency graph. ( my trail upload!). It uses Deutsch-Anderson equation of ESP efficiency.
A python code generating graphs of sca vs efficiency for different wk values is uploaded.
Run esp_v1.py, keeping esp_eff.py in the same folder.
esp_v2 gives effect of wk vs efficiency.
Effective precipitation rate, wk is in m/s. sca in sq.m/cubic m/s of gas flow.
esp_v3.py uses Deutsch equation. The precipitation rate is fed as wm, in m/s.
